  <p>
    Isn't it strange to need to show a photo ID
    during the sign-in for a crypto hackathon,
    attended by privacy-conscious developers?
  </p>
  <p>
    SkipID uses login with
    <a href="https://tor.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torus</a>
    to smooth out the process.
    Fill out your profile online, customize your badge,
    and then show your QR code from your phone at check-in.

    This is a project for the
    <a href="https://eth.boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETHBoston</a>
    hackathon!
    Created by four anonymous, sleepy, hungry, under/overcaffeinated developers.
